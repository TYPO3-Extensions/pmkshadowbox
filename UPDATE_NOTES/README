### README ###

The generation of the shadowbox script has changed dramatically, because the script is build on
runtime now. The configuration is very easy and mostly backwards compatible. See the notes
below for a list of specific configuration changes. The build functionality is completely
convered by unit tests!

## General Notes:

- Dropped support for TYPO3 below 4.3, because this should be a new major release (3.0)
- Some default values changed to fit the new shadowbox defaults
- tt_products is completely untested

## Values for the "iframeScrolling" configuration option

- yes -> always show the scrollbars
- no -> never show the scrollbars
- auto -> autodetection if the scrollbars are needed
- dynamic -> scrollbars will be enabled/disabled while resizing
  -> only useful in some cases and far way from perfection
- dynamic_noScrollFallback -> same as dynamic, but IE6/7 won't display the scrollbars anymore

## Added non-shadowbox options:

- useSizzle moved from shadowbox to non-shadowbox option
- players moved from shadowbox to non-shadowbox option
- adapter moved from shadowbox to non-shadowbox option
- preserveAspectWhileResizing - enable old resizing behaviour by default (the new one is extremely annoying)
- skinModificationDirectory -> more flexible approach than the skinPath variable
- flashPlayer -> option to change the default flash player
- flashExpressInstallScript -> option to change the default flash express install script

## Removed non-shadowbox options:

- jsFramework -> The user is responsible to include his framework himself now! An administrator
  should know how he can fulfill this condition.
- skipSetup -> moved to the shadowbox option with the same name (but reversed the default)
- iframeScrolling -> can be used as a rel attribute only now
  -> the global solution didn't made much sense
- skinPath -> replaced by the more flexible skinModification configuration variable

## Removed shadowbox configuration options:

- flvPlayer -> autoloaded by naming convention (player.swf inside the build path)
- flashBgColor -> replaced by the more general flashParams option
- autoDimensions -> no replacement
- handleException -> no replacement
- gdoc player doesn't exists anymore

## Added shadowbox configuration options:

Some were mentioned with background informations already before this section.

- troubleElements
- flashVars
- flashParams
- flashVersion
- skipSetup
