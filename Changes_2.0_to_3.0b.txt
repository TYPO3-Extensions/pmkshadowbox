PMK Shadowbox changes from updating Shadowbox from v2.0 to Shadowbox v3.0b.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Typoscript changes:

As of Shadowbox v3.0b, the adapter, language and plugin scripts are now loaded 
from the main Shadowbox itself.

- Adapters are autodetected, so no loading/config options is needed for this 
  anymore.

- Language and plugins are now defined by config options. This required a little 
  rewrite in the TS setup, in order to wrap those settings correctly. 
  (NOTE: The language part, might benefit from a simple userfunc, to check if the 
  lang file is present. - Added 1/6-09 Code is located at the bottom of the cache class.)

CHECK: Does the imagemap/area setup still work, or have I messed it up?
CHECK: Does the caching still work? (Now that he adapters, language and plugins 
       are autoloaded?)  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skins:

In order to have skin support, similar to that of Shadowbox v2.0, I moved the 
skin class of the main Shadowbox script, into a seperate file (placed in the 
skins folder as in v2.0)

TODO: Convert the old v2.0 skins into v3.0 format. (Or make some more interesting ones)
Done: Classic and ClassicCloseOnTop converted to 3.0b format.
      Added a classicWithSave with save and printing options (ripped from PMK Slimbox)

Extra:

TODO: Add support for "Shadowbox Mods - Thumbnails in overlay" by Peter Mitchell
      http://petemitch.110mb.com/shadowboxmods/1_thumbnails/shadowbox1a/

      Add the Flash and other new options to constants and setup. (See setup for list)
	  (NOTE: Im not quite sure what format they should be added in, as most of
	  them is not simple strings or booleans)
	  
      Remove the unused options from constants. (See setup for list)
	  
      Scripts and Stylesheets should be compressed in final version.
	  Or maybe the caching script could compress scripts before caching?
	  (PHP version of Packer and JSMin can be found in the t3mootols ext.)
